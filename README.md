# Django Admin Life Savers

### Add the custom action button in the django admin change list row

Here, we've crafted a straightforward model titled "Account" to manage user accounts and their balances. The two buttons, namely "Withdraw" and "Deposit," endowed with custom logic, will be displayed alongside each entry in the change list for the Account table, enabling seamless deposit and withdrawal functionalities.
